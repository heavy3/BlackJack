BlackJack
=========

This is a BlackJack card game written in C++. It is a single player game, in which the user will play against the dealer. The dealer will follow standard rules of a BlackJack Dealer. The user will be able to carry out all the funtionality in a normal black jack game: hit, stay, double down, and split when applicable. There may be visible statistics for the user to see to help them in making decisions. 

Note: Currently this is set up as a hi/lo card game so that I could test some of the deck capabilities. Blackjack rules will come soon!

There will be a GUI for this, but I am still not sure what I will be using, or if it will even be on the C++ platform. This application was primarily for me to get a little more practice with C++ before I started to TA for Programming 2 (which is taught in C++). I plan to port this to multiple platforms/languages in the future. I may create an IOS app that has multiple different card games in one. Sometimes you just want to play a simple card game for a few minutes, but who wants to download a bunch of different apps for basic card games. I will probably add (in addition to blackjack) Texas Holdem, Hi-Lo, War, Slapjack (maybe..? could be fun) and other single player card games.
